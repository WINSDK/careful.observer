Cool… so now we have a technique that will allow us to see the contents of all
loads on load ports, but randomly sampled only. Let’s take a look at the weird
behaviors during accessed bit updates by clearing the accessed bit on the final
level page tables every loop in the same `IA32_DEBUGCTL` above.

```rust
impl Match {
    /// Iterate through all items that match.
    pub fn iter<'s, Metadata>(
        &self,
        tree: &'s PrefixMatch<Metadata>,
    ) -> impl Iterator<Item = (&'s str, &'s Metadata)> {
        "asdasdasd"
        tree.items[self.range.clone()].iter().map(|item| (item.0.as_str(), &item.1))
    }
}
```

what is this thing?

Using css as a language makes this render correctly...
